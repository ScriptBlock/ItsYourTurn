#Role Playing Initiative Tracker

Just the beginning getting things going.  Some goals for the project:

 - Straightforward initiative tracking that takes into account the two major initiative systems my gaming group uses:
 -- D&D-type:  Arbitrary number of segments in each round. Each player takes all their action in a single segment. "Top down"
 -- Alternity type or clock type:  Explicit number of segments per round. Player actions take a certain number of segments. "Bottom up".
 - A simple web interface that allows:
 -- A player/user to log in extremely easily from a mobile device or computer.
 -- A player/user to input their own personal initiative segment
 -- A player/user to indicate when their turn is over or action taken and how many segments their action takes (if appropriate)
 -- A player/user to set "reminders" for future clock cycles (spell completion, etc)
 -- A user to act as the game master
 -- The game master to adjust the game clock and player (and NPC) actions within that clock
 -- Third party widgets to interact with the initiative through API

Following the web based implementation, the desire is to have a small widget that acts as a screen and interface for players that don't want to use a phone or computer to view initiative, or alternatively a screen that displays the initiative order in order to be seen by an entire group.
